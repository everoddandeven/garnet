            "Let’s say for simplicity that all your public relays use 500 as their limit. If you ask 10 " +

            "filter.nostr.wine, the MOST followers you will ever get back from our filter relay is 2000. " +
            "That doesn’t mean you only have 2000 followers or that your reach is reduced in any way.\\n\\nAs " +
